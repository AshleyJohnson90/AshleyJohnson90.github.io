# About    

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio!   
   
I'm **Ashley Johnson**, a software engineer with a knack for design and detail.   
   
I’m on track to graduate summa cum laude from Southern New Hampshire University in August 2024, earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My journey in this field began in August 2022, starting with no prior coding experience and only a basic understanding of computer science. Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in the world of technology, discovering the vast number of fascinating directions I can take my career in this field.

During my time at SNHU, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects:

Android Mobile Development: Built an inventory mobile app from the ground up using Java, Android Studio, and SQLite, this app showcases my ability to determine the best architecture that will create an interactive application with an emphasis on accessibility.
   
Full Stack Web Development: I created a comprehensive web application using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack, featuring an MVC-based client-facing interface and a Single Page Application for the admin panel, demonstrating my versatility in both frontend and backend development.   
   
3D Graphics Programming: I dipped my toe into graphics by developing a 3D scene and a brick-breaker-type game in C++ using OpenGL, highlighting my ability to tackle complex challenges in computer graphics.

This portfolio is a culmination of the growth and development I've achieved on the path to my degree. I've been able to simulate an Agile development process by iteratively and incrementally creating my enhancements. Jira has allowed me to participate in the software development lifecycle by giving me a space to break down my coding increments, instructor feedback, and keep track of my overall progress.

The code review allowed me to take a step back from my code and critically analyze it. Now that I have 2 years worth of coding experience under my belt, I was able to see the places for improvement and speak on the improvements I made to my code. This taught me a valuable lesson in the importance of understanding code and explaining its functions to other team members. Collaboration is critical in the workplace and I have to be able to demonstrate my code and explain my decisions to not only coworkers but stakeholders as well.   

The full stack webpage highlights my ability to create an industry-standard software design using innovative techniques and relevant tools. I was able to take a vague idea of a project and create a real-life valuable solution for SNHU students. This enhancement also highlights my adaptability and eagerness to learn. I had no experience in React, C#, .NET, or PostgreSQL prior to starting this enhancement. I was able to learn on the fly and incrementally create visually appealing, useful software.   
   
The text-based adventure game allowed me to experiment with many different types of data structures like graphs, trees, and dictionaries to identify the optimal choice for the project. I was able to deep dive into topics that I previously had only surface-level knowledge of. That led me to settle on a graph data structure. From there I was able to research algorithms to traverse the graph, like depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. I've gained an immense amount of knowledge on data structure and algorithms by finding the optimal solution for a real-world problem.
