# about   

hi! welcome to my portfolio   

i'm **ashley** and i'm an aspiring software engineer with a knack for design and detail.   
   
i started my journey, as many millennials did, tweaking my myspace background html to get it juuuuust right. now you can find me creating fullstack websites and applications.   
   
i'm set to graduate summa cum laude from southern new hampshire university in august 2024 with a bs in computer science.   
   
when i'm not furiously typing at my keyboard, you can find me out in the garden pulling weeds or hiking a trail deep in the woods with my golden pyrenees, louie.   
    
i want to thank you for taking the time to peruse my portfolio and i hope you like what you see!
