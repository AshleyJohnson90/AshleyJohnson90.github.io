**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**   
   
The original artifact is a program written in C++ that, from the terminal, allows the user to load a list of classes read from a file. From there they can make a selection to see a list of all the classes or search for a class. If the class is found in the loaded data, it will show the class name and prerequisites if applicable. This artifact was created in my first year of the program in the class CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms.   
   
**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**   
   
I chose this artifact because it shows how I can take a basic, abstract idea of a program and turn it into an application that many people would use. The original artifact showed that I had the ability to choose an effective way to sort and store the classes from the list using the binary search tree data structure. There were a number of different data structures I could have chosen for this project, but using the skills I learned in the class, I chose what I thought was the most efficient option. I improved the artifact by turning it into a full stack web application, porting from C++ to C# and using ASP.NET Core as the backend and React as the frontend. The user can still see all the classes with their prerequisites and can sort by subject. Each class also has a drop-down menu where the user can read the description of the class.   
   
**Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**   
   
I do think I meet the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement from module one. I have effectively used innovative technologies by using all new concepts to create this enhancement. I think the course listing page implements a computer solution that delivers value to students who are searching for classes to take. In just a few clicks they can find out important information about classes they want to take. I think there is still some work with the professional-quality visual communication portion of the second outcome I planned to meet. I do still have some design elements and functions I want to implement that I ran out of time to do or ran into some difficulty figuring out. I’m still reading documentation and researching those topics.   
   
**Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**   
   
I’ve learned quite a lot while enhancing the artifact. I’ve gotten to practice using the MVC structure to create a full stack application to maintain separation of concerns. I’ve learned about using UI libraries like React and then about open-source component projects built upon React, like Radix and Material UI. I’ve learned how important it is to plan out your application and read documentation of the libraries I used. It’s been a lot of information to take in at one time but I’m learning a lot of valuable lessons to take into a future career. I’ve faced challenges with styling the table where I store the classes. I didn’t realize there were defaults that I couldn’t just change with CSS, I had to create themes that override each default I want to change. This has taught me to inspect computed elements to find the name of the element so I can change it and to also see what is styling it that I do or do not want.
